# run starts the editor via 'go run'. Quickest path for development.
# For SSH/production use, prefer 'make build' and ship the binary.
run:
	go run .

# build produces a single binary at ./bin/$(BINARY).
build:
	mkdir -p bin
	go build -o bin/$(BINARY) .

# install copies the binary into /usr/local/bin so you can launch it as `spiceedit`.
install: build
	install -m 0755 bin/$(BINARY) /usr/local/bin/$(BINARY)

# build-linux cross-compiles a fully static linux/amd64 binary. Drop the
# resulting bin/$(BINARY)-linux-amd64 onto a remote box and run it inside
# tmux/zellij — no runtime, no libc, just one file.
build-linux:
	mkdir -p bin
	GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags='-s -w' -o bin/$(BINARY)-linux-amd64 .

# test runs the full suite with the race detector. The same command
# CI runs (.github/workflows/test.yml) — keep them in lockstep so a
# green CI is the same signal as a green local run.
test:
	go test -race ./...

# test-short is the quick local iteration loop: skip anything tagged
# slow with -short, no race detector. Use this while writing tests.
test-short:
	go test -short ./...

# coverage produces a coverage profile across every package and a
# rendered HTML report you can open in a browser.

	rm -rf bin coverage.out coverage.html

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Website targets — spice-edit.com lives in ./website (Hugo + Tailwind v4).
# Requires Hugo extended (>= 0.135) and Node (>= 18) on PATH.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# site-install pulls the npm deps the site needs (Tailwind CLI + npm-run-all).
# Idempotent — safe to re-run any time.
site-install:
	cd $(SITE_DIR) && npm install

# site-dev runs Tailwind in watch mode and Hugo's dev server in parallel,
# so edits to layouts, content, or CSS rebuild and live-reload at
# http://localhost:1313. Stops both on Ctrl+C.
site-dev:
	cd $(SITE_DIR) && npm run dev

# site-build produces the production-ready static site at $(SITE_DIR)/public.
# This is what the GitHub Pages workflow ships. The Tailwind build runs first
# so the minified CSS is on disk before Hugo reads its static directory.
site-build:
	cd $(SITE_DIR) && npm run build

# site-clean removes the generated build outputs. The npm cache and
# node_modules stay put — that's site-install's job to manage.
site-clean:
	rm -rf $(SITE_DIR)/public $(SITE_DIR)/static/css/site.css $(SITE_DIR)/resources
