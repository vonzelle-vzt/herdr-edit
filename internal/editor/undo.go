// undo.go gives every Tab a per-tab snapshot-based undo history plus a
// one-shot "revert to original" hatch.
//
// The model is intentionally simple: each entry is a full copy of the
// buffer's lines plus the cursor / anchor at the moment the snapshot was
// taken. That uses more memory than an operation log but keeps the code
// small enough to reason about and is plenty fast for the file sizes a
// terminal editor opens. The stack is FIFO-capped so a runaway typing
// session can't grow it forever.
//
// Coalescing — every typed rune doesn't get its own entry. Consecutive
// inserts of the same kind (typing, backspace, delete) inside a 500ms
// window collapse into a single undo step, so undoing a 50-character
// word is one click, not 50. Anything structural — pasting, hitting
// Enter, deleting a selection, an explicit cursor move — closes the
// current group so the next mutation starts a fresh entry.

package editor

import "time"

// maxUndoEntries caps the per-tab stack depth. 500 is generous enough
// that typical editing sessions never hit the wall; once we do, the
// oldest entry is dropped (FIFO) so the user can still undo a long
// way back without unbounded memory growth.
const maxUndoEntries = 500

// undoCoalesceWindow is the inactivity gap that closes a coalescing
// group. 500ms feels right — pause-and-think between words almost
// always lasts longer than this, while a typing burst lands well inside.
const undoCoalesceWindow = 500 * time.Millisecond

// undoGroup tags each snapshot with the kind of operation that produced
// it so consecutive ops of the same kind can be merged. Anything labelled
// undoGroupStructural never coalesces — it's the explicit "this is its
// own undo step" signal.
type undoGroup int

const (
	undoGroupNone       undoGroup = iota // no recent op — next push always lands.
	undoGroupTyping                      // a printable rune was inserted.
	undoGroupBackspace                   // a single char was removed before the cursor.
	undoGroupDelete                      // a single char was removed after the cursor.

// snapshot captures everything needed to reproduce the editor's content
// state at a moment in time. We don't include scroll position — undo is
// about *what* was in the buffer, not where the user happened to be
// looking — but cursor + anchor are part of the user's state.
//
// Marks rides along for the same reason cursor/anchor do: a breakpoint's
// LINE is part of what "this version of the buffer" means, and shiftMarks /
// dropMarksIn only ever renumber marks forward through live edits — they
// have no way to know an Undo just rewound the buffer out from under them.
// Without this, undoing a delete that killed a marked line would restore the
// text but leave the breakpoint gone, or undoing an insert would leave it
// sitting a few lines too low. persist.go's persistedSnapshot deliberately
// stays a separate type, so this field never touches the on-disk format.
