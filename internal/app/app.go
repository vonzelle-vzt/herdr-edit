// Package app is the editor's top-level glue: it owns the tcell screen,
// the file tree, the open tabs, and the event loop. The drawing is split
// into four panels (sidebar / tab bar / editor body / status bar) and the
// mouse dispatcher routes presses, drags, and wheel events to whichever
// panel the cursor is over.
//
// The editor is mouse-first by design — there are no Ctrl-keyed shortcuts
// because they collide with terminal flow control (Ctrl-S/Q) and tmux/zellij
// prefixes. Instead, every action lives behind a click on the ≡ icon at
// the top-left of the tab bar, which opens a centered modal of actions.

	// columns, so a 50-column panel left 20 for code, and dragging one column narrower replaced
	// the whole editor with "Window too small - please resize". A panel was only usable inside a
	// narrow band and gave no hint which way to go.
